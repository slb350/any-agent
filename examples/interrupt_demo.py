Interrupt Capability Demo

This example demonstrates how to use the interrupt() capability to cancel
long-running operations:

1. Timeout-based interruption
2. User-triggered interruption (simulated)
3. Interrupt with automatic tool execution

Note: This example uses LM Studio. Make sure LM Studio is running at
http://localhost:1234 with a model loaded before running.
